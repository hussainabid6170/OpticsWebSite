Here's a quick summary of how you set up your Eye Optics website using GitHub Pages and InfinityFree:

Step-by-Step Overview:
Created a Website Repository on GitHub:

You created a GitHub repository and uploaded your website files (e.g., index.html) to the repository.
Set Up GitHub Pages:

Enabled GitHub Pages for the repository by selecting the main branch under the GitHub Pages settings.
Configured your site to be publicly accessible using the GitHub Pages URL (e.g., https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name).
Registered a Free Domain with InfinityFree:

You obtained a free domain (eyeoptics.42web.io) using InfinityFree.
Verified that your domain was active and linked to your InfinityFree account.
Linked InfinityFree Domain to GitHub Pages Using DNS Records:

Updated the DNS Records for your domain in InfinityFree’s control panel:
Added A Records pointing to GitHub Pages’ IP addresses:
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
Set up a CNAME Record for www.eyeoptics.42web.io to point to your GitHub username’s GitHub Pages (e.g., yourusername.github.io).
Configured Cloudflare for Domain Management:

Added your domain to Cloudflare for enhanced DNS management.
Updated your domain’s nameservers to Cloudflare’s (found under the Cloudflare dashboard).
Set up CNAME Records and A Records in Cloudflare to point to GitHub Pages.
Verified Domain and HTTPS Setup:

Ensured that both https://eyeoptics.42web.io and https://www.eyeoptics.42web.io were correctly pointing to your GitHub Pages site.
Enabled HTTPS and SSL/TLS security in Cloudflare and GitHub.
Final Testing and Deployment:

Successfully tested the site using both the root domain (eyeoptics.42web.io) and the www subdomain.
Ensured that everything was working without errors, and your site was live for public access.
Outcome:
Your Eye Optics website is now hosted for free using GitHub Pages, mapped to a custom domain (eyeoptics.42web.io) using InfinityFree and managed through Cloudflare for security and performance optimization.
